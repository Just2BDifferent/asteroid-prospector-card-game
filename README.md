###Setup
Give each player 2 Fuel tokens and 3 Energy tokens.

###Goal
Be the first player to gather 6 Platinum tokens, or travel 60,000 KM [by adding the distances of all asteroids in front of a player].

###First Turn
Each player begins their first turn in Earth's Orbit with a limited supply of Fuel and Energy, and must last land on an Asteroid before they can collect materials.

###Turn Actions
Players can choose one of the actions on their turn:
  1. Discover, travel to and land on a new asteroid
  2. Extend your solar panels to collect energy from the sun's rays
  3. Mine the asteroid for materials
  4. Convert water into fuel*
  5. Repair damage*

\* Requires materials

####Discover, travel to and land on a new asteroid
Roll the dice and consult the dice chart for the die type you are using.  If you are out of fuel, see **_Out Of Fuel_** for additional instructions.

**Take Damage:** You are struck by a piece of floating space debris which damages your equipment; it might be repairable, but you need to land immediately.  Take the top card from the discard pile and immediately land there. You do not need to use your fuel to get to this asteroid. If there are no cards in the discard pile, take the bottom card from the asteroid deck instead. See **_Taking Damage_** for additional instructions.

**Draw 1:** Your equipment shows you there is a new asteroid in the vicinity. If you have the fuel to get to the asteroid, you may spend your fuel tokens to travel their and land. If you do so, turn over your current asteroid card and put the new card in front of you.  If you do not have the fuel, or do not wish to travel to that asteroid, you may place that asteroid on the discard pile; keep your current asteroid card face-up in front of you, if any.

**Draw 2:** Your equipment shows you there are two asteroids in your vicinity.  If you have the fuel to get to either asteroid, you may spend your fuel tokens to travel to either of them and land.  If you do so, turn over your current asteroid card and place the selected asteroid in front of you; put the other asteroid card on the discard pile.  If you do not have the fuel, or do not wish to travel to either asteroid, you may place both asteroids on the discard pile; keep your current asteroid card face-up in front of you, if any.

**Draw 3:** Your equipment shows you there are three asteroids in your vicinity.  If you have the fuel to get to any one of those asteroids, you may spend your fuel tokens to travel to one of those asteroids and land.  If you do so, turn over your current asteroid card and place the selected asteroid in front of you; put the other asteroid cards on the discard pile.  If you do not have the fuel, or do not wish to travel to these asteroids, you may place these asteroids on the discard pile; keep your current asteroid card face-up in front of you, if any.

####Extend your solar panels to collect energy from the sun's rays
Roll the dice and consult the dice chart for the die type you are using.  You take a day off from drilling to allow your vehicle to store energy from the solar panels for use in the future.

**Take Damage:** With no atmosphere to protect you, a solar flare has damaged your solar panels and you weren't able to store any of the sun's energy. See **_Taking Damage_** for additional instructions.

**Draw 1:** Unfortunately there were several large celestial bodies in your way, blocking your solar panels from collecting much of the sun's energy.  If you don't have 6 energy tokens already, draw 1 energy token.

**Draw 2:** You had an uninterrupted view of the sun all day, and your solar panels performed well.  If you don't have 6 energy tokens already, draw 2 energy tokens (up to a maximum of 6 energy).

**Draw 3:** Well, that was almost unexpected. It seems that your equipment did better than expected and you were able to store more energy than normal.  If you don't have 6 energy tokens already, draw 3 energy tokens (up to a maximum of 6 energy).

####Mine Asteroids
Roll the dice and consult the dice chart for the die type you are using. You may only mine an asteroid that you are currently on (face-up in front of you).

**Take Damage:** While you were drilling, your equipment malfunctioned and is now damaged. See **_Taking Damage_** for additional instructions.

**Draw 1:** Your drill was stopped while it was still near the surface, so you only get the materials closest to the surface.  If you don't already have 6 of the material in the left-most position of your asteroid, draw 1 token of that type.  If you already have 6 of that material, you are unfortunately unable to store any more and must leave it behind.

**Draw 2:** Your drill got through two layers of material, which means you have more materials for use later. For each material in the two left-most positions on your asteroid, if you don't already have 6 of that material, draw 1 token of that type; if you already have 6 of that material, you are unfortunately unable to store any more and must leave it behind.

**Draw 3:** When you checked on your drill, you found a giant pile of materials.  It looks like your drill got as far down as it could possibly get, making this a very happy day for you.  For each material on your asteroid, if you don't already have 6 of that material, draw 1 token of that type; if you already have 6 of that material, you are unfortunately unable to store any more and must leave it behind.

####Convert water into fuel
**Requires 2 Water + 1 Energy.**  
You fill your fuel convertor with water drilled from the asteroid's surface.  Your fuel convertor then shoots energy into the water, separating the hydrogen from the oxygen.  Your ship can use this as fuel for travelling between asteroids.  Spend 2 Water and 1 Energy token; gain 1 Fuel token.

####Repair Damage
**Requires either 2 Organics + 1 Metal + 1 Energy  _OR_ 1 Organics + 2 Metals + 1 Energy**
Your vehicle has taken some damage, and you want to repair it before things get any worse.  You shut down the solar panels and drilling equipment and you use your collected materials to repair your vehicle. Spend either 2 Organics + 1 Metal + 1 Energy _OR_ 1 Organics + 2 Metals + 1 Energy and discard the highest level of damage you have. (High Damage -> Medium Damage -> Light Damage)

####Taking Damage
If you have no damage yet, take the light damage token and place it in front of you.
If you only have light damage, take the medium damage token and place it in front of you.
If you have light and medium damage, take the heavy damage token in front of you. Discard all of your Metal, Organics, Energy and 2 Platinum tokens if you have them. Turn over your damage tokens.  For the next 3 turns, you may *only* discard one of your damage tokens.

####Out of Fuel
If you find yourself out of fuel, you can abandon the asteroid you are currently on by turning it over, and then proceed to the **Discover, travel to and land on a new asteroid** rules.  After discovering an asteroid, you can fly there without paying for the fuel - but for each fuel required to travel that distance, you will lose a turn.  On your next available turn, you take 1 damage.  See **Taking Damage** for additional information.
